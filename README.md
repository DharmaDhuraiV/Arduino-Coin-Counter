# Arduino-Coin-Counter
The problem statement is to create an Arduino counting machine using force sensors. This machine counts and sorts the coins in different sections with the help of an Infrared sensor. Here, an arrangement is made where IR sensors are placed to sense different coins, and Arduino UNO is used for processing the data and showing the total count value on an android application.
