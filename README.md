# Arduino-Coin-Counter
The problem statement is to create an Arduino counting machine using force sensors. <br>
This machine counts the coins using the weights of the different coins sensed by force sensors.<br>
Machine can also sort the coins in different sections with the help of an Infrared sensor. Here, an arrangement is made where IR sensors are placed to sense different coins, and Arduino UNO is used for processing the data and showing the total count value on an android application.<br>
The arrangement includes the usage of cardboard to contain the different IR sensors. The entry to different IR sensors will be the different size of the coins. So, one type of coin can enter only one section matching the size and the IR sensor will detect it.
